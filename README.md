build a CNN-based model that detects melanoma. A data set will be provided, which contains images of diffrent skin conditions. 
Understand the problem statement carefully and go through the evaluation.
1.Data Gathering: Obtain a dataset containing images of malignant and benign tumors. Ensure the dataset is properly labeled to differentiate between the two classes.
2.Data Preprocessing: Prepare the dataset for training by performing preprocessing tasks. This may involve resizing the images, normalizing pixel values, and splitting the dataset into training and evaluation sets.
3.Model Architecture Design: Design a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture suitable for melanoma detection. Construct the model by stacking convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers, considering factors such as depth and width.
4.Model Compilation: Compile the CNN model by specifying the appropriate loss function, optimizer, and evaluation metrics. Binary cross-entropy is commonly used as the loss function for binary classification tasks like distinguishing between malignant and benign tumors.
5.Model Training: Train the CNN model using the prepared training dataset. Adjust hyperparameters, such as learning rate and batch size, to optimize the model's performance. Techniques like data augmentation can be utilized to enhance the model's ability to generalize.
6.Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model using the evaluation dataset. Compute relevant metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, to assess the model's effectiveness in melanoma detection. Referring to the provided evaluation rubrics, ensure the model meets the specified criteria.
7.Model Refinement: Refine the model iteratively based on the evaluation results. This may involve adjusting the architecture, fine-tuning hyperparameters, or incorporating regularization techniques to improve generalization and performance.
8.Model Deployment: Once satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it to a production environment where it can be used for melanoma detection.
